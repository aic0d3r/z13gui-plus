# z13gui — Project Context for Claude

## What this project is

`z13gui` is a GTK4 Wayland layer-shell overlay drawer for controlling the 2025 ASUS ROG
Flow Z13 via the `z13ctl` daemon. It slides in from the right edge of the screen when the
Armoury Crate button (KEY_PROG3) is pressed. The daemon broadcasts `gui-toggle` events over
a subscribe socket; this GUI listens for them.

It has two display backends:
- **Layer-shell** (KDE/Wayland): margin-based slide animation
- **Gamescope** (Steam Gaming Mode): X11 overlay via `STEAM_OVERLAY` atom

- Module: `github.com/dahui/z13gui`
- Binary: `z13gui`

## Companion project: z13ctl

The `z13ctl` daemon (module `github.com/dahui/z13ctl`) is a sibling repo.
Its `api/` submodule (`github.com/dahui/z13ctl/api`) is published at tag `api/v1.1.6`
on GitHub.

During local development, a `go.work` file in this repo (if present, gitignored) provides
the local override. In production the `go.mod` imports the published tag.

## Key architectural decisions

- **Layer-shell** (KDE): `github.com/diamondburned/gotk4-layer-shell/pkg/gtk4layershell`
  (NOT `gtklayershell` which is GTK3). pkg-config name: `gtk4-layer-shell-0`.
- **Anchor**: right + top + bottom edges. Top/bottom margins set to 5% of screen height
  on realize. The surface is pinned to its monitor via `SetMonitor` (helps wlroots
  compositors clip overflow; KWin does NOT clip, see conditional fade below).
- **Keyboard mode**: `LayerShellKeyboardModeOnDemand` — gets focus when visible.
- **Animation**: layer-shell right-margin animation (`gtk4layershell.SetMargin`).
  `margin=0` → on-screen; `margin=-320` → off-screen to the right.
  Avoids GTK Revealer which causes pixman errors and smearing artifacts in Wayland.
- **Window visibility**: window is kept `SetVisible(true)` at all times after creation.
  It's "hidden" by setting margin = -(width-1) (off-screen) and opacity = 0, not by
  destroying/hiding the surface. This prevents the ghost-surface artifact that KDE Plasma
  shows when remapping a surface. The 1px margin keeps the surface in KWin's composited
  output for damage tracking; opacity 0 makes the sliver invisible to the user.
- **Width**: `SetSizeRequest(320, -1)`. Height is natural (content-driven, scrolled).
- **Show/hide animation**: smoothstep easing via `AddTickCallback` (VSync-synced),
  with a shared `animGen` generation counter so a show cancels an in-flight hide
  (and vice versa). Two paths, chosen per Show/Hide by `hasRightNeighbor()`:
  - **No monitor to the right** → slide the right margin (`slideMargin`). Show sets
    opacity=1 then slides in; Hide slides out then sets opacity=0 (hides the 1px
    sliver on the primary's own right edge).
  - **A monitor to the right** → fade in place (`fadeOpacity`) at margin 0, fully on
    the primary, then park the transparent surface off-screen. A rightward slide
    would otherwise bleed onto that monitor because KWin doesn't clip layer-surface
    overflow to the assigned output. `Backend.margin`/`Backend.opacity` track current
    state; use `setMargin`/`setOpacity` to keep them in sync.
- **State source of truth**: daemon is the source of truth. On show, `api.SendGetState()`
  is called and `syncState()` updates widgets. Widget signals are suppressed during sync
  via `Window.syncing bool`.
- **Subscribe loop**: background goroutine, exponential backoff reconnect, dispatches
  `Toggle()` via `glib.IdleAdd`.
- **CSS architecture**:
  - `layout.css` → `STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION` (structural, not overridable)
  - `theme-default.css` → `STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER` (colors, user-overridable)
  - No `hexpand: true` in CSS — use `widget.SetHExpand(true)` in Go instead.
  - No `box-shadow` on `.drawer` — it causes smearing outside the widget clip region
    during slide animations in Wayland Vulkan rendering.
  - No `AddMark()` on scales — scale marks inside an animated context cause GTK
    `GtkGizmo` allocation warnings and pixman errors.
  - CSS class hierarchy for text labels in custom view:
    - `.section-label` — section headers ("TDP", "UNDERVOLT", "FAN CURVE"): 11px, bold, letter-spaced, dim
    - `.scale-name` — slider name labels ("PL1 (SPL)", "CPU Curve Optimizer"): 10px, bold, no letter-spacing, dim
    - `.scale-value` — slider value readouts ("50 W", "CPU CO: -20"): 10px, normal weight, bright
- **Profile selector**: physical-profile buttons (`quiet`, `balanced`,
  `performance`), stored in `w.profileBtns map[string]*gtk.Button`. Fan, TDP,
  and undervolt are independent overrides; there is no selectable Custom
  profile. Not DropDown (popup broken in gamescope).
- **Focus-loss dismiss** (layer-shell): `EventControllerMotion` tracks `pointerInside`
  on the backend. On `notify::is-active` focus loss: if within 500ms of Show, ignored
  (compositor settle time for keyboard-mode transition). If pointer is inside, the drop
  is spurious (KDE Plasma briefly drops focus during keyboard-mode transitions) → ignored.
  If pointer is outside, user clicked elsewhere → dismiss after 200ms confirmation delay.
  Do NOT add a `focusedSinceShow` guard — it causes first-show dismiss regression on KDE
  where the compositor drops focus during keyboard-mode transition and never re-grants it.
  Escape key also dismisses in both backends.
- **GTK_A11Y=none**: set in `main.go` and `contrib/z13gui.service`. Disables GTK4
  AT-SPI accessibility bridge, which sends D-Bus events on every widget state change.
  Under systemd (especially gamescope sessions), the AT-SPI bus may be unavailable,
  causing D-Bus timeouts that block GTK initialization.

## Gamescope backend (`internal/gui/gamescope/gamescope.go`)

The gamescope backend renders z13gui as an X11 overlay in Steam Gaming Mode.

- **Overlay type**: `STEAM_OVERLAY` atom (z-pos 3, interactive with input routing).
  NOT `GAMESCOPE_EXTERNAL_OVERLAY` (z-pos 2, display-only, no input).
- **Visibility**: opacity-based (`_NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY`). Window stays mapped always.
- **Input**: keyboard-only X11 grab (`XGrabKeyboard`) + `STEAM_INPUT_FOCUS` atom.
  `XGrabPointer` was removed because its core X11 event mask interferes with XI2
  touch delivery. STEAM_INPUT_FOCUS handles pointer/touch routing natively.
- **Scaling**: resolution-based CSS scaling (`outputWidth / 1707`). Reference 1707 = 2560/1.5
  (matches KDE 150% at Z13 native resolution). `Z13GUI_SCALE` env var overrides.
  GDK_SCALE CANNOT be used — causes double scaling (GTK + gamescope scaler).
- **Layout**: fullscreen window → horizontal box (backdrop + right-aligned panel).
  Panel has 5% top/bottom margins, scaled drawer width.
- **Popups don't work**: GTK4 popovers/dropdowns create separate X11 windows that
  gamescope doesn't composite. Solved via view switching (see below).

### View switching

In both KDE and gamescope modes, `buildContent()` wraps content in a `gtk.Stack` with 4 pages:
- `"main"` — normal drawer (profiles, RGB, battery, etc.)
- `"custom"` — internal stack key for the Advanced Tuning view (TDP, fan curve,
  undervolt, telemetry); the user-facing profile is still physical
- `"theme"` — theme picker (radio buttons + accent dots)
- `"color"` — HSL color picker (H/S/L sliders + presets + preview)

Both backends use these stack pages; no popovers are constructed. `hide()` resets to "main".

### Service environment

`contrib/z13gui.service` uses `EnvironmentFile=-%t/gamescope-environment` (optional).
`main.go` validates the gamescope Wayland socket exists before selecting the backend
to handle stale environment files after session switching.

## API usage (`github.com/dahui/z13ctl/api`)

Functions used:
- `api.SendGetState() (bool, *api.State, error)` — fetch full daemon state on show
- `api.Subscribe([]string{"gui-toggle"}) (<-chan string, func(), error)` — event stream
- `api.SendApply(device, color1, color2, mode, speed string, brightness int) (bool, error)`
- `api.SendOff(device string) (bool, error)` — turn off lighting for a device
- `api.SendProfileSet(profile string) (bool, error)`
- `api.SendBatteryLimitSet(limit int) (bool, error)`
- `api.SendPanelOverdriveSet(value int) (bool, error)` — 0 or 1
- `api.SendBootSoundSet(value int) (bool, error)` — 0 or 1
- `api.SendTdpSet(watts, pl1, pl2, pl3 string, force bool) (bool, error)` — set TDP
- `api.SendTdpReset() (bool, error)` — reset TDP to firmware defaults
- `api.SendFanCurveSet(curve string) (bool, error)` — set custom fan curve ("temp:pwm,..." format)
- `api.SendFanCurveReset() (bool, error)` — reset fan curves to auto
- `api.SendUndervoltSet(cpu string) (bool, error)` — set CPU Curve Optimizer offset
- `api.SendUndervoltReset() (bool, error)` — reset undervolt to stock (0)

Key types from `api`:
```go
type State struct {
    Lighting           LightingState
    Devices            map[string]LightingState  // keyed by "keyboard", "lightbar"
    Profile            string
    Battery            int
    BootSound          int  // 0 or 1
    PanelOverdrive     int  // 0 or 1
    TDP                *TDPState
    FanCurve           *FanCurveState
    Undervolt          *UndervoltState
    UndervoltAvailable bool  // true if ryzen_smu is loaded
    Temperature        int   // APU temp, degrees Celsius
    FanRPM             int   // fan1 speed in RPM
}
type LightingState struct {
    Enabled bool; Mode string; Color string; Color2 string
    Speed string; Brightness int
}
type TDPState struct {
    PL1SPL int; PL2SPPT int; FPPT int
}
type FanCurveState struct {
    Mode   int              // 0=auto, 1=custom
    Points []FanCurvePoint  // 8 points
}
type FanCurvePoint struct {
    Temp int; PWM int
}
type UndervoltState struct {
    CPUCO  int   // all-core CPU Curve Optimizer offset (0 to -40)
    Active bool  // true when CO is applied to hardware
}
```

## Daemon socket

Path: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/z13ctl/z13ctl.sock`

Daemon must be running for any `api.*` calls to succeed. If the daemon is not running,
`api.Subscribe` returns `nil, nil, nil` and `SendGetState` returns `false, nil, nil`.
The subscribe loop handles this with backoff retry.

## Build

```sh
make build      # CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o z13gui .
sudo make install  # installs pre-built binary to /usr/local/bin/z13gui
make lint       # golangci-lint run ./...
make clean      # rm z13gui
make snapshot   # goreleaser local build (no publish)
make release    # goreleaser build + publish
```

Requires at build time: `gtk4-layer-shell` C library (`pkg-config gtk4-layer-shell-0`).

## Known GTK issues (do not re-introduce)

- **`hexpand: true` in CSS** — not a valid CSS property. Use `widget.SetHExpand(true)` in Go.
- **`scale.AddMark()`** — causes `GtkGizmo (slider) reported min width -2` warnings and
  pixman `Invalid rectangle` errors when the scale widget is in an animated context.
  Display-only values work fine with `SetDrawValue(true)`.
- **`gtk.Revealer` with `SlideLeft`** — causes smearing artifacts in Wayland Vulkan
  rendering because GTK's damage region doesn't properly clear the transparent areas left
  behind as the revealer collapses. Use layer-shell margin animation instead.
- **`SetSizeRequest` + Revealer** — keeping the window at fixed width while the Revealer
  collapses internally still leaves stale pixels; the compositor doesn't know the content
  region shrank.
- **`box-shadow` on animated containers** — shadow pixels extend outside the widget clip
  region and are not cleared each frame in Wayland Vulkan rendering, causing smearing.
- **GTK4 popovers in gamescope** — create separate override-redirect X11 windows that
  gamescope doesn't composite. Use `gtk.Stack` view switching instead (gamescope only).
- **GDK_SCALE in gamescope** — causes double scaling (GTK scales buffer, then gamescope
  scaler scales again). Use manual CSS scaling via `scaledCSS()` instead.
- **GtkDropDown in gamescope** — popup list is a separate X11 window. Use buttons or
  radio buttons instead. Profile selector uses `gtk.Button` with CSS `.active` class.
- **CheckButton/Switch touch in gamescope** — GTK4's CheckButton and Switch use an
  internal BUBBLE-phase GestureClick, which fails for touch input in gamescope/XWayland.
  Button widgets use CAPTURE phase and work fine. Workaround: `addTouchActivate()` in
  controls.go adds a touch-only (`SetTouchOnly(true)`) CAPTURE-phase GestureClick to each
  affected widget. Do not remove — without it, all CheckButtons and Switches are
  untappable via touchscreen in gamescope mode.

## Current status

Feature-complete for both KDE and gamescope modes:
- Margin-based slide animation (smoothstep, 200ms) — KDE
- Gamescope X11 overlay with opacity-based visibility + keyboard grab + STEAM_INPUT_FOCUS
- Touch activation workaround for gamescope (CAPTURE-phase GestureClick on CheckButton/Switch)
- Pointer-inside guard for KDE focus-loss handling (spurious drop vs genuine click-outside)
- GTK_A11Y=none for systemd AT-SPI timeout prevention
- RGB lighting controls (mode, color presets + custom chooser/HSL picker, speed, brightness)
- Profile switching via buttons (quiet/balanced/performance/custom)
- Custom profile view with:
  - TDP control: basic (single watt slider) and advanced (PL1/PL2/PL3) modes
  - Fan curve editor: 8-point Cairo graph with drag interaction, 35–105°C range
  - Undervolt: independent CPU Curve Optimizer slider (inside advanced TDP box,
    hidden when `ryzen_smu` unavailable).
    iGPU CO is not supported on Strix Halo.
  - Telemetry: APU temp + fan RPM in header and custom view, polled every 1s
  - Separate save/reset buttons for TDP, fans, and undervolt
- Battery charge limit slider
- Panel overdrive and boot sound toggles (footer switches)
- 15 built-in themes with accent variants + custom theme.toml support
- Gamescope view switching: theme picker view + HSL color picker view
- Resolution-based CSS scaling for gamescope (Z13GUI_SCALE override)
- Split-level logging (app=Info, GTK=Error; `-d` enables all Debug)
- goreleaser + GitHub Actions release pipeline
- systemd user service with optional gamescope-environment loading
